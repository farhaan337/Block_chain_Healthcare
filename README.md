# Block_chain_Healthcare
ðŸ”¹ Blockchain Solution in Healthcare

Each block stores a medical record (patient details, diagnosis, prescriptions, etc.).

The blockchain ensures:

Immutability â€“ Once a record is added, it canâ€™t be changed.

Transparency â€“ All stakeholders (hospitals, doctors, patients) can verify authenticity.

Security â€“ Records are linked with cryptographic hashes, preventing tampering.
ðŸ”¹ How This Solves the Healthcare Problem

Secure Medical Records: Each patientâ€™s record is stored in a block and linked using cryptographic hashes, preventing tampering.

Data Integrity: If someone tries to alter Aliceâ€™s diagnosis, the hash will mismatch, making the blockchain invalid.

Decentralization: Hospitals, doctors, and patients can access the same verified data without relying on a single central server.

Transparency & Trust: Patients gain more trust knowing their records are immutable and traceable.
