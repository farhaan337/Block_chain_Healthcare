Each block stores a medical record (patient details, diagnosis, prescriptions, etc.).

The blockchain ensures:

Immutability â€“ Once a record is added, it canâ€™t be changed.

Transparency â€“ All stakeholders (hospitals, doctors, patients) can verify authenticity.

Security â€“ Records are linked with cryptographic hashes, preventing tampering.
